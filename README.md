# Movie Management Mini Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Movie Management Mini Project! This is a small-scale project aimed at practicing fundamental object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. As a learner who is currently focusing on understanding classes, objects, methods, encapsulation, ArrayLists, and enums, I have created this project to apply and solidify my knowledge in these areas.

I've also taken on the challenge of conducting this project entirely in English as part of my language practice efforts.

## Description

The Movie Management project provides users with various movie-related functionalities, including:

- Registering movies by specifying their ID, name, author, release year, and genre.
- Removing movies from the collection based on their unique ID.
- Listing all movies stored in the system.
- Filtering movies by genre.
- Filtering movies by genre and release year.

## How to Run

To run the project locally on your machine, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rpalbq/MovieManagement.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd movie-management

3.  Compile the Java code:

    ```bash
    javac application/*.java

4. Run the program:
   
    ```bash
     java application.Program

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the movie management system.

# Future Enhancements
As I continue to expand my programming knowledge and skills, I plan to make ongoing improvements and enhancements to this project. These future enhancements may include:

- Implementing error handling and validation for user input.
- Adding data persistence to save and load movie information.
- Incorporating more advanced features and functionalities, such as the ability to edit movie details, including name, author, genre, and release year.

If you come across any language-related issues or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to provide feedback. :)
